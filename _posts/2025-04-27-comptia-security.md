### **Summary**
CompTIA Security+ is a certification that has gained populairty and became the favorite for most people trying to break into the cybersecurity field. It is not just a basic Cybersecurity certification, but a certification that is required in many positions. 

### **My Experience**
It has been a certification I've been looking to obtain since I decided to undertake my journey in cybersecurity. Since the price is not very accessible for most people in Latinamerica it was a bit of a journey to obtain it. Through this journey I encounter several ways to obtain discounts for the certification which I'll explain later in detail. 

Comparing it a bit with ISC2 - Certified in Cybersecurity, I can say that while they share many similarities, they offer different takeaways. The content in CompTIA Security+ is notably more in-depth, providing a deeper understanding of certain topics but I can reafirm what I said before, ISC2 - Certified in Cybersecurity was a great preparation for this certification. 

It took me about 3 months to study for this certification while doing University and other activities. I'll admit that at the beginning, I didn't have the most effective study approach, but over time, I improved it and was able to pass the exam with what I consider a good score.

While this certification is still quite theorical, it is well-regarded both in the US and Latinamerica. There are few key points to know about the exam and I'll be listing the resources I used to prepare. It is also worth to mention that this certification doesn't target a specific role within cybersecurity, rather, it ensures that the applicant has the general knowledge required to work in field.

2. **Dion Training.** They sell exam vouchers with a ~10% discount + 50% off the Practice exam app.
3. **Professor Messer.** Offers Security+ test voucher with a ~10% discount + Exam Hacks eBook.
4. **Non-Profit.** Some non-profit associations have programs to help you get this certifications at a better price or even provide training for them.

### **Study Resources Recommendations**
For the Security+ I really tried different methods. As I did this certification through a Non-Profit Organization, they provided me with certain resources and as well I got some on the side to reinforce:
- [CertMaster Practice for Security+ (SY0-701)](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/resources/certmaster-training/practice/) This is a set of questions divided by domain and subdomain to help you test what you've study and check weak points. If you have the means to aquire this, **I highly recommend it**, the kind of questions you'll take in the actual test are worded in very similar way. 
- [CertMaster Labs for Security+ (SY0-701)](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/resources/certmaster-training/labs/) Be aware that **completing all these labs takes an insane amount of time**, it is very well worth it if you haven't had any practical experience before, since you'll encounter simulated labs that will cover each area of the test in a practical way, but if you just want to pass the test, this won't really help much.
- [Professor Messer - CompTIA SY0-701 Security+ Training course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv&si=qs1eNLbGOZfJgBO3) I think if you haven't had any contact with the topics covered in the certification, this is a great way to get familiar with them. 
- [Jason Dion - Udemy CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) Complete Course & Practice Exam](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/?couponCode=MT250915G3) I think this course is really just what you need to pass the test, it is very well worded and I feel it helped me to actually correlate concepts in a more understanding way. **Note:** I didn't get its practice questions, just the course. 
- [Sybex CompTIA Security+ Study Guide by Mike Chapple](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/CompTIA+Security%2B+Study+Guide+with+over+500+Practice+Test+Questions%3A+Exam+SY0-701%2C+9th+Edition-p-9781394211425) This guide was amazing, it is very well word it and well you can get it either in Wiley, Amazon, O'reilly,and couple other stores. You get free access to the online practice questions in the [Sybex Test Banks Site](https://login.education.wiley.com/login?login_success_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcheckout.education.wiley.com%2Ftest-bank-redemption) which is what I used to study on hand with the CertMaster Practice. I have free access to O'Reilly and that was enough to access the extra content.
- [Sybex CompTIA Security+ Practice Tests, 3rd Edition](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/CompTIA+Security%2B+Practice+Tests%3A+Exam+SY0-701%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781394211395) Same with this book, I used the bank test and it really was a great experience to review some material. You can get both books as a bundle too.
- [Pearson - CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Cert Guide (Certification Guide)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0138293082/ref=sspa_dk_offsite_brave_1?psc=1&aaxitk=5cc631d9aaa9793002c913f4f44f6abd&tqtoken=AgR4Y9RdzLzvxKJgfAWCmix11Y5yUEhfpfsgMrr33t5rl5YAGgABAAlyZWNpcGllbnQAC0FtYXpvbkFkc1RRAAEAEWF3cy1rbXMtaGllcmFyY2h5ACRiM2NlMjE3OS0wMzJhLTQ5NTAtOWFlZC00MTczZDMxZmNhMmEAXGQ1u76NR6GLMUhX60-kx7wrHf1Hscl8xzV7HFDtK8nXMwFE6ZdgvB9GW5UIDLfnWRh9ZR21gAHXtJ3xjIR5-Ns7JUHTgvB3WFLKoeXmWGRBOsMwzhZAalsW0p_wAgAAEABiCzW2II0xRAmjkMNgypPmJAuKfs6OoOQYRA6ajvExB-PrdYTMFeawYkUrifquCkD_____AAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAABspugPTdkjIcQXZp7B_S-5MqXZLuTGIv3L2ZEh8Uhule8oESNffzHeSR9eR&offsiteFlag=1) I tried this guide, and at the beggining I think I had a bad approach to my study because I was just reading it and it took way too much time. It is a great guide and I would just recommend it to check topics and review exercises.
- [Cyberkraft - Security+ SY0-701 PBQs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkY1OVVHzVljGOe8WAkKGc4GT8ZAKaav) I would highly recommend watching this playlist to get an idea of the kind of PBQ you'll get in the test. Usually you get 3-5 PBQ in a test. Mine were all about networking, so I wish you good luck!
- [Pearson Practice Test](https://learning.oreilly.com/certifications/9780135311332/) I didn't really use this practice test for this certification, but I did for the Network+ (which I'll make a post as well) and this practice test was really worth doing, so I wanted to recomend it over here too. I got access to it through O'Reilly.
- **Some other resources**
  - Mike Chappel Linkedin Course: I personally didn't like it and found it very boring. Contrary to the ISC2 - CC where his course is very well made for that certification. (This was my first approach into studying for Sec+)
  - Andrew Ramdayal: I personally didn't like his way of teaching and I think lot of concepts were left on the side, but mind myself since I only watch the first couple of videos and left it.

### **Study Tips**
- It is faster to study watching videos, but as well it is important to make notes and do active recall on what you are learning.
- It is important to start doing the practice questions from the beggining, I did them every time I would finish a subdomain/domain.
- I did couple full lenght tests 1 week before the test and aim to score about 90%. Don't get scared if at the beggining you score 60%, it is normal at the beggining and it's better to get that score while practicing than in the real test. So, don't let that discourage you.
- Only use approved materials to study, I've seen people on the internet getting their certifications revoked because they used a practice test bank that was on a black list, so please just be mindful of that.

### **Test Day Tips**
- Don't do anything overstimulating.
- Be calm.
- Leave the PBQ for the end.
- Don't think too much, but enough.
- Flag questions you are not sure, but answer all of them before going to the PBQ in case you don't have enough time at the end to review them all.
